# What Drives the Price of a Car?
### Problem Statement
Our consulting firm specializes in providing technology solutions for the automotive industry. Currently, we are working on a project for a client that involves developing an AI/ML model. This model aims to identify the factors that impact the pricing of used cars in the market and predict their prices. We're thrilled to embark on this journey to explore the world of cars, unlock mysteries, and have fun together!

After applying CRISP-DM techniques to build a model for our automobile client, we have uncovered key data insights and developed a price estimator to optimize business operations.
